# Below is the simplest way of solving problem (T-SQL in SQL Server or MYSQL 8.0+)
SELECT Score,DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Score DESC) as Rank
FROM Scores
ORDER BY Score DESC

##  IF RANK() does not work

select b.score, (select count(*) 
				from (select distinct score from scores) as a 
				where a.score >= b.score) as rank
			from (select distinct score from scores) as b
			order by b.score desc
