# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT avg(n1.Number) as median
FROM Numbers n1
WHERE n1.Frequency >= abs((SELECT sum(n2.frequency) FROM Numbers n2 WHERE n1.Number>=n2.Number)-
                       (SELECT sum(n2.frequency) FROM Numbers n2 WHERE n1.Number<=n2.Number)  )
                       
## an important algorithm to note
# For the median number its Frequency should be no less than the subtraction of (the sum frequency of numbers which is higher) and(the sum frequency of numbers which is lower)
